/// A widget that detects gestures.
///
/// Attempts to recognize gestures that correspond to its non-null callbacks.
///
/// If this widget has a child, it defers to that child for its sizing behavior.
/// If it does not have a child, it grows to fit the parent instead.
///
/// {@youtube 560 315 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhVXkCFPmK4}
///
/// By default a GestureDetector with an invisible child ignores touches;
/// this behavior can be controlled with [behavior].
///
/// GestureDetector also listens for accessibility events and maps
/// them to the callbacks. To ignore accessibility events, set
/// [excludeFromSemantics] to true.
///
/// See <http://flutter.dev/gestures/> for additional information.
///
/// Material design applications typically react to touches with ink splash
/// effects. The [InkWell] class implements this effect and can be used in place
/// of a [GestureDetector] for handling taps.
///
/// {@tool dartpad}
/// This example contains a black light bulb wrapped in a [GestureDetector]. It
/// turns the light bulb yellow when the "TURN LIGHT ON" button is tapped by
/// setting the `_lights` field, and off again when "TURN LIGHT OFF" is tapped.
///

/// {@end-tool}
///
/// {@tool dartpad}
/// This example uses a [Container] that wraps a [GestureDetector] widget which
/// detects a tap.
///
/// Since the [GestureDetector] does not have a child, it takes on the size of its
/// parent, making the entire area of the surrounding [Container] clickable. When
/// tapped, the [Container] turns yellow by setting the `_color` field. When
/// tapped again, it goes back to white.
///
/// ** See code in examples/api/lib/widgets/gesture_detector/gesture_detector.1.dart **
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// ### Troubleshooting
///
/// Why isn't my parent [GestureDetector.onTap] method called?
///
/// Given a parent [GestureDetector] with an onTap callback, and a child
/// GestureDetector that also defines an onTap callback, when the inner
/// GestureDetector is tapped, both GestureDetectors send a [GestureRecognizer]
/// into the gesture arena. This is because the pointer coordinates are within the
/// bounds of both GestureDetectors. The child GestureDetector wins in this
/// scenario because it was the first to enter the arena, resolving as first come,
/// first served. The child onTap is called, and the parent's is not as the gesture has
/// been consumed.
/// For more information on gesture disambiguation see:
/// [Gesture disambiguation](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/advanced/gestures#gesture-disambiguation).
///
/// Setting [GestureDetector.behavior] to [HitTestBehavior.opaque]
/// or [HitTestBehavior.translucent] has no impact on parent-child relationships:
/// both GestureDetectors send a GestureRecognizer into the gesture arena, only one wins.
///
/// Some callbacks (e.g. onTapDown) can fire before a recognizer wins the arena,
/// and others (e.g. onTapCancel) fire even when it loses the arena. Therefore,
/// the parent detector in the example above may call some of its callbacks even
/// though it loses in the arena.
///
/// {@tool dartpad}
/// This example uses a [GestureDetector] that wraps a green [Container] and a second
/// GestureDetector that wraps a yellow Container. The second GestureDetector is
/// a child of the green Container.
/// Both GestureDetectors define an onTap callback. When the callback is called it
/// adds a red border to the corresponding Container.
///
/// When the green Container is tapped, it's parent GestureDetector enters
/// the gesture arena. It wins because there is no competing GestureDetector and
/// the green Container shows a red border.
/// When the yellow Container is tapped, it's parent GestureDetector enters
/// the gesture arena. The GestureDetector that wraps the green Container also
/// enters the gesture arena (the pointer events coordinates are inside both
/// GestureDetectors bounds). The GestureDetector that wraps the yellow Container
/// wins because it was the first detector to enter the arena.
///
/// This example sets [debugPrintGestureArenaDiagnostics] to true.
/// This flag prints useful information about gesture arenas.
///
/// Changing the [GestureDetector.behavior] property to [HitTestBehavior.translucent]
/// or [HitTestBehavior.opaque] has no impact: both GestureDetectors send a [GestureRecognizer]
/// into the gesture arena, only one wins.
///
/// ** See code in examples/api/lib/widgets/gesture_detector/gesture_detector.2.dart **
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// ## Debugging
///
/// To see how large the hit test box of a [GestureDetector] is for debugging
/// purposes, set [debugPaintPointersEnabled] to true.
///

///  * [Listener], a widget for listening to lower-level raw pointer events.
///  * [MouseRegion], a widget that tracks the movement of mice, even when no
///    button is pressed.
