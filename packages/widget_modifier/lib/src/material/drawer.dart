/// Drawers are typically used with the [Scaffold.drawer] property. The child of
/// the drawer is usually a [ListView] whose first child is a [DrawerHeader]
/// that displays status information about the current user. The remaining
/// drawer children are often constructed with [ListTile]s, often concluding
/// with an [AboutListTile].
///
/// The [AppBar] automatically displays an appropriate [IconButton] to show the
/// [Drawer] when a [Drawer] is available in the [Scaffold]. The [Scaffold]
/// automatically handles the edge-swipe gesture to show the drawer.

/// {@tool snippet}
/// This example shows how to create a [Scaffold] that contains an [AppBar] and
/// a [Drawer]. A user taps the "menu" icon in the [AppBar] to open the
/// [Drawer]. The [Drawer] displays four items: A header and three menu items.
/// The [Drawer] displays the four items using a [ListView], which allows the
/// user to scroll through the items if need be.
///
/// ```dart
/// Scaffold(
///   appBar: AppBar(
///     title: const Text('Drawer Demo'),
///   ),
///   drawer: Drawer(
///     child: ListView(
///       padding: EdgeInsets.zero,
///       children: const <Widget>[
///         DrawerHeader(
///           decoration: BoxDecoration(

///             'Drawer Header',
///             style: TextStyle(

///
/// An open drawer may be closed with a swipe to close gesture, pressing the
/// the escape key, by tapping the scrim, or by calling pop route function such as
/// [Navigator.pop]. For example a drawer item might close the drawer when tapped:

/// ListTile(
///   leading: Icon(Icons.change_history),
///   title: Text('Change history'),
///   onTap: () {
///     // change app state...
///     Navigator.pop(context); // close the drawer
