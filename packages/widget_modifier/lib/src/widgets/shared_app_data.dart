///
/// - `SharedAppData.getValue(context, key, initCallback)` creates a dependency
/// on the key and returns the value for the key from the shared data table.
/// If no value exists for key then the initCallback is used to create
/// the inËšitial value.
///
/// - `SharedAppData.setValue(context, key, value)` changes the value of an entry
/// in the shared data table and forces widgets that depend on that entry
/// to be rebuilt.
///
/// A widget whose build method uses SharedAppData.getValue(context,
/// keyword, initCallback) creates a dependency on the SharedAppData. When
/// the value of keyword changes with SharedAppData.setValue(), the widget
/// will be rebuilt. The values managed by the SharedAppData are expected
/// to be immutable: intrinsic changes to values will not cause
/// dependent widgets to be rebuilt.
///
/// An instance of this widget is created automatically by [WidgetsApp].
///
/// There are many ways to share data with a widget subtree. This
/// class is based on [InheritedModel], which is an [InheritedWidget].
/// It's intended to be used by packages that need to share a modest
/// number of values among their own components.
///
/// SharedAppData is not intended to be a substitute for Provider or any of
/// the other general purpose application state systems. SharedAppData is
/// for situations where a package's custom widgets need to share one
/// or a handful of immutable data objects that can be lazily
/// initialized. It exists so that packages like that can deliver
/// custom widgets without requiring the developer to add a
/// package-specific umbrella widget to their application.
///
/// A good way to create an SharedAppData key that avoids potential
/// collisions with other packages is to use a static `Object()` value.
/// The `SharedObject` example below does this.
///
/// {@tool dartpad}
/// The following sample demonstrates using the automatically created
/// `SharedAppData`. Button presses cause changes to the values for keys
/// 'foo', and 'bar', and those changes only cause the widgets that
/// depend on those keys to be rebuilt.

/// value could be shared within an app. A Flutter package that
/// provided custom widgets might use this approach to share a (possibly
/// private) value with instances of those widgets.
