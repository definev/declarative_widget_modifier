/// A container first surrounds the child with [padding] (inflated by any
/// borders present in the [decoration]) and then applies additional
/// [constraints] to the padded extent (incorporating the `width` and `height`
/// as constraints, if either is non-null). The container is then surrounded by
/// additional empty space described from the [margin].
///
/// During painting, the container first applies the given [transform], then
/// paints the [decoration] to fill the padded extent, then it paints the child,
/// and finally paints the [foregroundDecoration], also filling the padded
/// extent.
///
/// Containers with no children try to be as big as possible unless the incoming
/// constraints are unbounded, in which case they try to be as small as
/// possible. Containers with children size themselves to their children. The
/// `width`, `height`, and [constraints] arguments to the constructor override
/// this.
///
/// By default, containers return false for all hit tests. If the [color]
/// property is specified, the hit testing is handled by [ColoredBox], which
/// always returns true. If the [decoration] or [foregroundDecoration] properties
/// are specified, hit testing is handled by [Decoration.hitTest].
///
/// ## Layout behavior
///
/// _See [BoxConstraints] for an introduction to box layout models._
///
/// Since [Container] combines a number of other widgets each with their own
/// layout behavior, [Container]'s layout behavior is somewhat complicated.
///
/// Summary: [Container] tries, in order: to honor [alignment], to size itself
/// to the [child], to honor the `width`, `height`, and [constraints], to expand
/// to fit the parent, to be as small as possible.
///
/// More specifically:
///
/// If the widget has no child, no `height`, no `width`, no [constraints],
/// and the parent provides unbounded constraints, then [Container] tries to
/// size as small as possible.
///
/// If the widget has no child and no [alignment], but a `height`, `width`, or
/// [constraints] are provided, then the [Container] tries to be as small as
/// possible given the combination of those constraints and the parent's
/// constraints.
///
/// If the widget has no child, no `height`, no `width`, no [constraints], and
/// no [alignment], but the parent provides bounded constraints, then
/// [Container] expands to fit the constraints provided by the parent.
///
/// If the widget has an [alignment], and the parent provides unbounded
/// constraints, then the [Container] tries to size itself around the child.
///
/// If the widget has an [alignment], and the parent provides bounded
/// constraints, then the [Container] tries to expand to fit the parent, and
/// then positions the child within itself as per the [alignment].
///
/// Otherwise, the widget has a [child] but no `height`, no `width`, no
/// [constraints], and no [alignment], and the [Container] passes the
/// constraints from the parent to the child and sizes itself to match the
/// child.
///
/// The [margin] and [padding] properties also affect the layout, as described
/// in the documentation for those properties. (Their effects merely augment the
/// rules described above.) The [decoration] can implicitly increase the
/// [padding] (e.g. borders in a [BoxDecoration] contribute to the [padding]);
/// see [Decoration.padding].
///
/// ## Example
///
/// {@tool snippet}
/// This example shows a 48x48 amber square (placed inside a [Center] widget in
/// case the parent widget has its own opinions regarding the size that the
/// [Container] should take), with a margin so that it stays away from
/// neighboring widgets:
///
/// ![An amber colored container with the dimensions of 48 square pixels.](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/widgets/container_a.png)
///
/// ```dart
/// Center(
///   child: Container(
///     margin: const EdgeInsets.all(10.0),
///     color: Colors.amber[600],
///     width: 48.0,
///     height: 48.0,
///   ),
/// )
/// ```
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// {@tool snippet}
///
/// This example shows how to use many of the features of [Container] at once.
/// The [constraints] are set to fit the font size plus ample headroom
/// vertically, while expanding horizontally to fit the parent. The [padding] is
/// used to make sure there is space between the contents and the text. The
/// [color] makes the box blue. The [alignment] causes the [child] to be
/// centered in the box. Finally, the [transform] applies a slight rotation to the
/// entire contraption to complete the effect.
///
/// ![A blue rectangular container with 'Hello World' in the center, rotated
/// slightly in the z axis.](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/widgets/container_b.png)
///
/// ```dart
/// Container(
///   constraints: BoxConstraints.expand(
///     height: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headline4!.fontSize! * 1.1 + 200.0,
///   ),
///   padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8.0),
///   color: Colors.blue[600],
///   alignment: Alignment.center,
///   transform: Matrix4.rotationZ(0.1),
///   child: Text('Hello World',
///     style: Theme.of(context)
///         .textTheme
