/// A Material Design "Outlined Button"; essentially a [TextButton]
/// with an outlined border.
///
/// Outlined buttons are medium-emphasis buttons. They contain actions
/// that are important, but they arenâ€™t the primary action in an app.
///
/// An outlined button is a label [child] displayed on a (zero
/// elevation) [Material] widget. The label's [Text] and [Icon]
/// widgets are displayed in the [style]'s
/// [ButtonStyle.foregroundColor] and the outline's weight and color
/// are defined by [ButtonStyle.side].  The button reacts to touches
/// by filling with the [style]'s [ButtonStyle.overlayColor].
///
/// The outlined button's default style is defined by [defaultStyleOf].
/// The style of this outline button can be overridden with its [style]
/// parameter. The style of all text buttons in a subtree can be
/// overridden with the [OutlinedButtonTheme] and the style of all of the
/// outlined buttons in an app can be overridden with the [Theme]'s
/// [ThemeData.outlinedButtonTheme] property.
///
/// Unlike [TextButton] or [ElevatedButton], outline buttons have a
/// default [ButtonStyle.side] which defines the appearance of the
/// outline.  Because the default `side` is non-null, it
/// unconditionally overrides the shape's [OutlinedBorder.side]. In
/// other words, to specify an outlined button's shape _and_ the
/// appearance of its outline, both the [ButtonStyle.shape] and
/// [ButtonStyle.side] properties must be specified.
///
/// {@tool dartpad}
/// Here is an example of a basic [OutlinedButton].
///
/// ** See code in examples/api/lib/material/outlined_button/outlined_button.0.dart **
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// The static [styleFrom] method is a convenient way to create a
/// outlined button [ButtonStyle] from simple values.
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [ElevatedButton], a filled Material Design button with a shadow.
///  * [TextButton], a Material Design button without a shadow.
