///
/// On multitouch devices, multiple drags can occur simultaneously because there
/// can be multiple pointers in contact with the device at once. To limit the
/// number of simultaneous drags, use the [maxSimultaneousDrags] property. The

///
/// This widget displays [child] when zero drags are under way. If
