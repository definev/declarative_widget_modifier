/// as a [SingleChildScrollView], [ListView] or [GridView], to have the whole
/// sheet be draggable.

///
/// This widget can be dragged along the vertical axis between its
/// [minChildSize], which defaults to `0.25` and [maxChildSize], which defaults
/// to `1.0`. These sizes are percentages of the height of the parent container.
///
/// The widget coordinates resizing and scrolling of the widget returned by
/// builder as the user drags along the horizontal axis.
///
/// The widget will initially be displayed at its initialChildSize which
/// defaults to `0.5`, meaning half the height of its parent. Dragging will work
/// between the range of minChildSize and maxChildSize (as percentages of the
/// parent container's height) as long as the builder creates a widget which
/// uses the provided [ScrollController]. If the widget created by the
/// [ScrollableWidgetBuilder] does not use the provided [ScrollController], the
/// sheet will remain at the initialChildSize.
///
/// By default, the widget will stay at whatever size the user drags it to. To
/// make the widget snap to specific sizes whenever they lift their finger
/// during a drag, set [snap] to `true`. The sheet will snap between
/// [minChildSize] and [maxChildSize]. Use [snapSizes] to add more sizes for
/// the sheet to snap between.
///
/// By default, the widget will expand its non-occupied area to fill available
/// space in the parent. If this is not desired, e.g. because the parent wants
/// to position sheet based on the space it is taking, the [expand] property
/// may be set to false.
///

///
/// This is a sample widget which shows a [ListView] that has 25 [ListTile]s.
/// It starts out as taking up half the body of the [Scaffold], and can be
/// dragged up to the full height of the scaffold or down to 25% of the height
/// of the scaffold. Upon reaching full height, the list contents will be
/// scrolled up or down, until they reach the top of the list again and the user
/// drags the sheet back down.
