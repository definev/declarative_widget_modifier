/// A typical tab view is used as the content of each tab in a
/// [CupertinoTabScaffold] where multiple tabs with parallel navigation states
/// and history can co-exist.
///
/// [CupertinoTabView] configures the top-level [Navigator] to search for routes
/// in the following order:
///
///  1. For the `/` route, the [builder] property, if non-null, is used.
///
///  2. Otherwise, the [routes] table is used, if it has an entry for the route,
///     including `/` if [builder] is not specified.
///
///  3. Otherwise, [onGenerateRoute] is called, if provided. It should return a
///     non-null value for any _valid_ route not handled by [builder] and [routes].
///
///  4. Finally if all else fails [onUnknownRoute] is called.
///
/// These navigation properties are not shared with any sibling [CupertinoTabView]
/// nor any ancestor or descendant [Navigator] instances.
///
/// To push a route above this [CupertinoTabView] instead of inside it (such
/// as when showing a dialog on top of all tabs), use
/// `Navigator.of(rootNavigator: true)`.
///

///
///  * [CupertinoTabScaffold], a typical host that supports switching between tabs.
///  * [CupertinoPageRoute], a typical modal page route pushed onto the
///    [CupertinoTabView]'s [Navigator].
