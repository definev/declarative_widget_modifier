/// Opacity(
///   opacity: _visible ? 1.0 : 0.0,
///   child: const Text("Now you see me, now you don't!"),
/// )
/// ```
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// This is more efficient than adding and removing the child widget from the
/// tree on demand.
///
/// ## Performance considerations for opacity animation
///
/// Animating an [Opacity] widget directly causes the widget (and possibly its
/// subtree) to rebuild each frame, which is not very efficient. Consider using
/// an [AnimatedOpacity] or a [FadeTransition] instead.
///
/// ## Transparent image
///
/// If only a single [Image] or [Color] needs to be composited with an opacity
/// between 0.0 and 1.0, it's much faster to directly use them without [Opacity]
/// widgets.
///
/// For example, `Container(color: Color.fromRGBO(255, 0, 0, 0.5))` is much
/// faster than `Opacity(opacity: 0.5, child: Container(color: Colors.red))`.
///
/// {@tool snippet}
///
/// The following example draws an [Image] with 0.5 opacity without using
/// [Opacity]:
///
/// ```dart
/// Image.network(
///   'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flutter/assets-for-api-docs/master/packages/diagrams/assets/blend_mode_destination.jpeg',
///   color: const Color.fromRGBO(255, 255, 255, 0.5),
///   colorBlendMode: BlendMode.modulate
/// )
/// ```
///
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// Directly drawing an [Image] or [Color] with opacity is faster than using
/// [Opacity] on top of them because [Opacity] could apply the opacity to a
/// group of widgets and therefore a costly offscreen buffer will be used.
/// Drawing content into the offscreen buffer may also trigger render target
/// switches and such switching is particularly slow in older GPUs.
///

/// ### Why use a [Padding] widget rather than a [Container] with a [Container.padding] property?
///
/// There isn't really any difference between the two. If you supply a
/// [Container.padding] argument, [Container] simply builds a [Padding] widget
/// for you.
///
/// [Container] doesn't implement its properties directly. Instead, [Container]
/// combines a number of simpler widgets together into a convenient package. For
/// example, the [Container.padding] property causes the container to build a
/// [Padding] widget and the [Container.decoration] property causes the
/// container to build a [DecoratedBox] widget. If you find [Container]
/// convenient, feel free to use it. If not, feel free to build these simpler
/// widgets in whatever combination meets your needs.
///
/// In fact, the majority of widgets in Flutter are simply combinations of other
/// simpler widgets. Composition, rather than inheritance, is the primary
/// mechanism for building up widgets.
///
/// See also:
///

/// This widget creates a separate display list for its child, which
/// can improve performance if the subtree repaints at different times than
/// the surrounding parts of the tree.
///
/// This is useful since [RenderObject.paint] may be triggered even if its
/// associated [Widget] instances did not change or rebuild. A [RenderObject]
/// will repaint whenever any [RenderObject] that shares the same [Layer] is
/// marked as being dirty and needing paint (see [RenderObject.markNeedsPaint]),
/// such as when an ancestor scrolls or when an ancestor or descendant animates.
///
/// Containing [RenderObject.paint] to parts of the render subtree that are
/// actually visually changing using [RepaintBoundary] explicitly or implicitly
/// is therefore critical to minimizing redundant work and improving the app's
/// performance.
///
/// When a [RenderObject] is flagged as needing to paint via
/// [RenderObject.markNeedsPaint], the nearest ancestor [RenderObject] with
/// [RenderObject.isRepaintBoundary], up to possibly the root of the application,
/// is requested to repaint. That nearest ancestor's [RenderObject.paint] method
/// will cause _all_ of its descendant [RenderObject]s to repaint in the same
/// layer.
///
/// [RepaintBoundary] is therefore used, both while propagating the
/// `markNeedsPaint` flag up the render tree and while traversing down the
/// render tree via [PaintingContext.paintChild], to strategically contain
/// repaints to the render subtree that visually changed for performance. This
/// is done because the [RepaintBoundary] widget creates a [RenderObject] that
/// always has a [Layer], decoupling ancestor render objects from the descendant
/// render objects.
///
/// [RepaintBoundary] has the further side-effect of possibly hinting to the
/// engine that it should further optimize animation performance if the render
/// subtree behind the [RepaintBoundary] is sufficiently complex and is static
/// while the surrounding tree changes frequently. In those cases, the engine
/// may choose to pay a one time cost of rasterizing and caching the pixel
/// values of the subtree for faster future GPU re-rendering speed.
///
/// Several framework widgets insert [RepaintBoundary] widgets to mark natural
/// separation points in applications. For instance, contents in Material Design

/// This widget is a simple inline alternative to defining a [StatelessWidget]
/// subclass. For example a widget defined and used like this:
///
/// ```dart
/// class Foo extends StatelessWidget {
///   @override
///   Widget build(BuildContext context) => Text('foo');
/// }
///
/// Center(child: Foo())
/// ```
///
/// Could equally well be defined and used like this, without
/// defining a new widget class:
///
/// ```dart
/// Center(
///   child: Builder(
///     builder: (BuildContext context) => Text('foo');
///   ),
/// )
/// ```
///
/// The difference between either of the previous examples and simply
/// creating a child directly, without an intervening widget, is the
/// extra [BuildContext] element that the additional widget adds. This
/// is particularly noticeable when the tree contains an inherited
/// widget that is referred to by a method like [Scaffold.of],
/// which visits the child widget's BuildContext ancestors.
///
/// In the following example the button's `onPressed` callback is unable
/// to find the enclosing [ScaffoldState] with [Scaffold.of]:
///
/// ```dart
/// Widget build(BuildContext context) {
///   return Scaffold(
///     body: Center(
///       child: TextButton(
///         onPressed: () {
///           // Fails because Scaffold.of() doesn't find anything
///           // above this widget's context.
///           print(Scaffold.of(context).hasAppBar);
///         },
///         child: Text('hasAppBar'),
///       )
///     ),
///   );
/// }
/// ```
///
/// A [Builder] widget introduces an additional [BuildContext] element
/// and so the [Scaffold.of] method succeeds.
///
/// ```dart
/// Widget build(BuildContext context) {
///   return Scaffold(
///     body: Builder(
///       builder: (BuildContext context) {
///         return Center(
///           child: TextButton(
///             onPressed: () {
///               print(Scaffold.of(context).hasAppBar);
///             },
///             child: Text('hasAppBar'),
///           ),
